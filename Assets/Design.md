# 2D Multiplayer Dungeon

## Key Concepts
    
- Multiplayer
- Kill enemies, get loot (original i know)
- Be able to PvP (Even if it's just a limited form)
- Quests with rewards
- Inventory
    - Weapons
    - Potions
    - Currency
    - Materials
    - Armor
- Procedural 
- Free Roam
- Different areas/worlds
    - different recommended power levels
    - Story missions, grindable dungeons

- Incremental Aspects
    - Combining loot

## Design Questions
- How should the story work?
    - Campaign like D2
    - Like battle cats

- How should multiplayer work?
    - Say you want to group up, do you transfer characters?
    - How do you balance that. Does it matter?
 
- What is the goal?
    - Collect?
    - Beat Story?
    - What's the endgame like/ why keep playing?
    
- What makes dungeons and levels different from each other?
    - Mob difficulty, mob types, loot drops

- How should cosmetics work if at all?
    - Armor on character in overworld probably too much work without dedicated artist

- How should multiplayer be balanced?
    - Probably just more enemies, nothing crazy
    

## What makes Destiny 2D different
- Procedural?
    - Procedural Everything?

## Gameplay 

### General
- Start with empty character
- Fight weak enemies, get starter loot
- Story/Main Quest
    - Levels
- Free Roam areas that lead to levels
- Grindable Dungeons

- Different levels with terrain
    - For each level there would be different tiers where the same mobs would be more powerful, but drop more stuff
    - Each level has a dungeon that is custom made? that can drop special loot
    - Specific mobs can drop a special material. These can be used to create buildings/weapons/items. Buildings would be passive grind. Can upgrade buildings with more grinding in levels or time passed. 
    - Prestige system? Reset with what rewards? For now there can be a final dungeon etc etc then game/story is done

### Attacks
- Swing or Jab for melee
- Some magic projectile for mage
- Throwables (Consumed)
    - Grenades

### Abilities 
- Instant Heal
- Speed Up
- More Damage
- Dome Shield (Really want to do this)
- (Needs more non generic things)


### Crafting
- Combining weapons together
- Make new weapons with materials
    - This might be pointless idk 
    - Could be the cheaper form of weapons
        - Weapons drop semi rarely and materials always drop


### Dungeons
- What happens when you die?
- What makes you finish a level?
    - Grind until your done
    - Mini Boss
    - Treasure room

- Infinite, can find treasure rooms
- Die, lose a percent of materials for that run
- I like this idea, maybe you have a chance to find special mobs that drop special loot. Like shiny mobs/mini bosses

## Ideas

- Mini games
- Crafting/combining like terraria
- Waves of enemies
    - Survival, get rewards/materials based on how long you survive (duh)

- Hub world?
    - Entrances to things
    - Shops

- Pkm Mystery Dungeon levels

- Collection book

- Build stuff to get resources over time through finding stuff in dungeons to build them.
    - Where are these buildings at. Are they in hub world, maybe just in a menu. Placeable? Can you get more than one?
    - Would this be necessary to progress, or just a nice to have. I feel like a nice to have would be best but then what would be the point. 

- Tap Titans but as a rouge like?
 - This direction is interesting.
