# 2D Multiplayer Dungeon

## Key Concepts
    
- Multiplayer
- Kill enemies, get loot (original i know)
- Be able to PvP (Even if it's just a limited form)
- Quests with rewards
- Inventory
    - Weapons
    - Potions
    - Currency
    - Materials
    - Armor
- Procedural 
- Free Roam
- Different areas/worlds
    - different recommended power levels
    - Story missions, grindable dungeons

- Incremental Aspects
    - Combining loot

## Design Questions
- How should the story work?
    - Campaign like D2
    - Like battle cats

- How should characters work?
    - Say you want to group up, do you transfer characters?
    - How do you balance that. Does it matter?
 
- What is the goal?
    - Collect?
    - Beat Story?
    - What's the endgame like/ why keep playing?
    
- What makes dungeons and levels different from each other?

- How should cosmetics work if at all?
    - Armor on character in overworld probably too much work without dedicated artist

- How should multiplayer be balanced?
    - Probably just more enemies, nothing crazy
    

## What makes Destiny 2D different
- Procedural?
    - Procedural Everything?

## Gameplay 

### General
- Start with empty character
- Fight weak enemies, get starter loot
- Story/Main Quest
    - Levels
- Free Roam areas that lead to levels
- Grindable Dungeons

### Attacks
- Swing or Jab for melee
- Some magic projectile for mage
- Throwables (Consumed)
    - Grenades

### Abilities 
- Instant Heal
- Speed Up
- More Damage
- Dome Shield (Really want to do this)
- (Needs more non generic things)


### Crafting
- Combining weapons together
- Make new weapons with materials
    - This might be pointless idk 
    - Could be the cheaper form of weapons
        - Weapons drop semi rarely and materials always drop
